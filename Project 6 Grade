Dear Natalie McGuckin,

Here is the feedback for your answer to Project 6.

Score: 10/10 - Good job!

Additional comments:
- Please upload the correct RMD file - A quick
  double-check would be sufficient!
  (No points deducted as you have the correct
  contents in the PDF file.)
  Also, you may want to double check your PDF
  file to make sure the contents are displayed
  properly.
- Instead of the function tail(), you can change the 
  order of sort() by including the argument decreasing=FALSE.
  For example, try the two lines of R code:
    sort(c(1, 3, 2));
    sort(c(1, 3, 2), decreasing = FALSE);
- I can see you are using the awk array for Question 2.
  Don't you want to try the challenge question?
  All you need is to replace 
    count[$10] + 1
  by
    count[$10] + $15
  Try it :)
  
Best,
Yumin

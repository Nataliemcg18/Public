1.  Use the airline data stored in this directory:

/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009

1a. What was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

nmcguck@scholar-fe06:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv |awk -F, '{pizza = pizza+ $15; count=count+1} END{print pizza/count} '
7.03274

-made a statement going through each file, used 15 because it was the 15th column. Count is adding up each one. Pizza/count= average. 

1b. What was the average departure delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

nmcguck@scholar-fe06:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat 2005.csv |awk -F, '{pizza = pizza+ $16; count=count+1} END{print pizza/count} '
8.51186


1cd. Now revise your solution to 1ab, to account for the delays (of both types) in the full set of data, across all years.

nmcguck@scholar-fe06:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat allyears.csv |awk -F, '{pizza = pizza+ $16; count=count+1} END{print pizza/count} '
8.01844
nmcguck@scholar-fe06:/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009 $ cat allyears.csv |awk -F, '{pizza = pizza+ $15; count=count+1} END{print pizza/count} '
6.9023

2. Revise your solutions to 1abcd to only include flights that took place on the weekends.

 cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 > 5) {pizza += $16; count += 1}} END{print pizza/count}'
7.55609

cat allyears.csv | awk -F, '{if($4 > 5) {pizza += $15; count += 1}} END{print pizza/count}'
5.30331

 
3.  Consider the June 2017 taxi cab data, which is located in this folder:

/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018

What is the average distance of a taxi cab ride in New York City in June 2017?

cat yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv | awk -F, '{total = total+ $5; count=count+1}  END{print total/count}' 
2.97862

Total divided by the number of lines.
